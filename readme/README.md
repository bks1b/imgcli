## About
`imgcli` is a command line interface for image manipulation tools. I wrote it as an experiment with [Jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) and canvas outside of the browser, and image manipulation in general.

## Installation
- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >=10 if you haven't already.
- Clone or download the repository
- `npm i`
- `npm ls -g typescript || npm i typescript -g`
- `tsc && npm i . -g`
- The `img` command should now be available.
